# UnityTwine
**Turn Twine stories into Unity scripts.**

Includes a parser and importer for .twee files, and a class (TwineStory) for running stories in a Unity scene.

Documentation and more examples will be up shortly.

#####Getting started
1. Download [Plugins/UnityTwine](https://github.com/daterre/UnityTwine/tree/master/Assets/Plugins/UnityTwine) and place it in your project's plugin folder.
2. Export your story in .twee format from Twine 1.x, or use the [Entweedle](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Entweedle/) story format for Twine 2.x.
3. Drag the .twee file into Unity.
3. This creates a .cs file with the same name which you can use like a regular script. [Here are some examples.](#examples)

#####What you should know
- You need to have basic scripting skills to get the story to run. Look at the [Example scene](https://github.com/daterre/UnityTwine/tree/master/Assets/Example) for some ideas.

#####Examples
I'm writing them up as we speak!
